\section{Version}

This documentation refers to version 1.2.0 

Although the development is devoted to mantain the compatibility with previous versions, the newer versions will probably show small differences in the behaviour of the program or in the defaults, in addition to new features. Before using the program, check that the version corresponds to the one reported in this manual.

\section{Presentation}

\texttt{EXAT} (Excitonic Analysis Tool) is a Molecolab tool\footnote{\texttt{http://molecolab.dcci.unipi.it} ---
For help or to report a bug, please write to
\texttt{lorenzo.cupellini@unipi.it}.}. You can obtain the latest version of the program at \texttt{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3948072}.

The program performs excitonic calculations from external input, or from the results of Gaussian (R) 16 calculations.

\section{Usage}

\subsection{Software prerequisites and compiling}

\texttt{EXAT} is written in Python. The \texttt{numpy} and \texttt{scipy} packages are needed. Additionally, \texttt{matplotlib} is needed to view the excitonic spectrum.  


\subsection{Needed input files}\label{sec:input}

Before running \texttt{EXAT}, you need a calculation with Gaussian16 on the system of interest with the \texttt{eet=fragment} keyword. An example input file is shown in the following
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
#p td(nstates=4) b3lyp/6-31G(d) eet(fragment=4)

Title line

0 1 
[geometry]

\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Important:} note that the \texttt{\#p} keyword specified in the route section generates additional print that \texttt{EXAT} will read, and therefore is needed to perform the excitonic calculation.

Alternatively, you can provide external files with site energies, couplings, and dipole moments (see below).

The optional \texttt{chromlist} file should be specified in order to use the \texttt{--seltran} option (see the Usage). The file shoud contain the selected chromophores, one per line. The first column contains the chromophore number; the transitions to select should be specified on the same line Here is an example of a \texttt{chromlist.in} file:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
1  1 2
3  1 2 4
4  1 3
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This input tells \texttt{EXAT} to consider only fragments \texttt{1}, \texttt{3}, and \texttt{4}, and to select transitions 1 and 2 of chromophore 1, transitions 1, 2 and 4 of chromophore 3, and transitions 1 and 3 of chromophore 4.


\subsubsection{External input}\label{sec:input_ext}

\texttt{EXAT} is able to read input from external text files. In this case, several input files are needed. A \texttt{chromlist} file as described in Section~\ref{sec:input} is required, and the transitions should always be specified. The total number of transitions is calculated from the transitions specified in this file.

\paragraph*{Site energy file. } 
This file specifies the energy of the transitions (Units are eV). Its default name is \texttt{site.in}. It should specify the transition energy of every chromophore, one line per chromophore, \emph{in the same order as the \texttt{\emph{chromlist}} file.} The first column should contain the chromophore number. The other column should contain the site energies of the transitions. For example:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
1  1.56 2.20
3  1.58 2.14 2.60
4  1.60 2.60
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Dipoles file. } 
This file specifies the transition dipole moments (In Debye units). Its default name is \texttt{dipo.in}. It should contain a line for every transition, specifying the components $x$, $y$ and $z$ of the transition dipole. The dipoles should be specified in the same order as in the \texttt{chromlist} file, and then in the order of the transitions. 

\paragraph*{Centers file. } 
This file specifies the centers of the transitions. Its default name is \texttt{cent.in}. The format is the same as the dipoles file. The units are Angstrom.

\paragraph*{Coupling file. } 
This file specifies all couplings between transitions on different chromophores. The default name is \texttt{coup.in}. The file contains one coupling per line and should be sorted in increasing order of chromophore and transition (\texttt{Chrom1 Chrom2 Tran1 Tran2}, excluding \texttt{Chrom1 $=$ Chrom2}). The units are cm$^{-1}$.

\emph{The format of this file will be changed in later versions.}

\subsection{Running the program}

The command-line call to \texttt{EXAT} depends on the type of input (see Section~\ref{sec:input}). In the next sections the required commands for the various input types are presented.

\subsubsection{Running from Gaussian 16 output}

The command-line syntax for running \texttt{EXAT} from a the Gaussian logfile is:

\begin{framed}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
$> exat.py [options] [chromlist] -i logfile
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{framed}

where \texttt{logfile} is the Gaussian log file of the EET calculation, and ChromList is the list of fragment as described in Section~\ref{sec:input}. 


\subsubsection{Running with external input}

The text files needed for external input are described in Section~\ref{sec:input_ext}, with their format. The program should be called as:

\begin{framed}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
$> exat.py -e [chromlist] [--indipo dipofile] \
  [--incoup coupfile] [--insite sitefile] [--incent centfile]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{framed}

where \texttt{dipofile} contains the transition dipoles, \texttt{coupfile} contains the couplings, \texttt{sitefile} contains the site energies, and \texttt{centfile} contains the transition centers. These files need to be specified only if their name is different from the default name (See Section~\ref{sec:input_ext}).

\item[\texttt{-{}-reorient}] Followed by the IDs of two atoms that define an axis, with respect to which the transition dipoles will be reoriented. Signs of transition dipoles will be changed until all dipoles point in the same direction as the defined axis. The signs of the couplings will be changed accordingly.
%\item[\texttt{-{}-forcedipo}] If used with the \texttt{-{}-reorient} option, forces the dipole to be parallel to the defined axis.
\item[\texttt{-{}-anadipo}] Followed by an input file that specifies a reference frame for every chromophore defined in \texttt{chromlist}. This option activates the transition dipole direction analysis, see Section~\ref{sec:anadipo} for a brief description. It cannot be used with external input. When this option is activated, \texttt{EXAT} will try to reorient dipoles automatically.
\item[\texttt{-{}-indipo}] Followed by a transition dipole file. The format of the dipole file is described in Section~\ref{sec:input_ext}. The transition dipoles read in input will be overridden.

\end{description}


\section{Advanced functions}

\subsection{Dipole analysis}\label{sec:anadipo}

The \texttt{-{}-anadipo} option activates the analysis of dipole moment direction with respect to a chromophore-specific reference frame. Moreover, it is possible to change the azimuth and polar angles of the dipole, mantaining the same magnitude.

The internal reference frame can be defined, for every chromophore, by specifying three atoms (\texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, and \texttt{C}). The $xy$ plane is the plane identified by these three atoms. The $\vec{AB}$ vector defines the $x$ axis of the reference frame. The $\vec{AC}$ vector defines the orientation of the $y$ axis with respect to the $x$ axis. The $z$ axis is then automatically defined by the right-hand rule. 

The azimuth ($\theta$) and polar ($\phi$) angles are then defined as follows: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:deftheta}
 \theta = \dfrac{\pi}{2} - \arccos\left(\dfrac{\bs{\mu}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}}{\mu}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:defphi}
 \phi = \arctan\left(\dfrac{\bs{\mu}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{y}}}{\bs{\mu}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{x}}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$, $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ are the direction of the axes in the internal reference frame, $\bs{\mu}$ is the dipole, and $\mu$ is its magnitude. The angle $\theta$ therefore represents the deviation of $\bs{\mu}$ from the \texttt{ABC} plane, and $\phi$ is the angle that the projection of $\bs{\mu}$ on the \texttt{ABC} plane makes with the $\vec{AB}$ vector. 

Before running the analysis, the transition dipoles are reoriented in order to be as close as possible to a pre-defined set of angles. In this way, this option can be used in place of the \texttt{-{}-reorient} option to reorient different transitions in different ways.

The input file for dipole analysis has the following format. It contains one line per chromophore, in the same order as the \texttt{chromlist} file. The first column is the chromophore number. The following three columns contain the IDs of three atoms that define the reference frame as described above. The following columns can be used to define a pre-defined orientation in terms of $\theta$ and $\phi$, and possibly to fix the dipole in that orientation. As an example, for the same system shown above: 

\begin{framed}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
1    3 11 6     0.0    0.0   0.0   90.0
3    4 10 5     0.0    0.0f 
4    3 11 6     0.0   60.0   0.0  -40.0f
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{framed}

This file specifies to use atoms 3,11, and 6 of chromophores 1 and 4 for building their internal reference frames, whereas atoms 4,10, and 5 are used for chromophore 3. 
The other columns specify that:
\begin{itemize}
\item For transition 1 of \texttt{1}, reference $\theta$ and $\phi$ are 0. The sign of the transition is changed if the dipole is oriented in the opposite direction.
\item For transition 2 of \texttt{1}, reference $\theta$ is 0 and $\phi$ is 90. This means that if the dipole is oriented with $-180 < \phi < 0$, the sign of the transition will be changed.
\item For transition 1 of \texttt{3}, $\theta$ and $\phi$ references are 0, but now $\phi$ is forced to be zero.
\item For any other transition of \texttt{3}, the references are 0.
\item For transition 2 of \texttt{4}, the angle $\phi$ is forced to be -40.
%\item \dots
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use in python scripts}

The newer versions of \texttt{EXAT} have some API functionalities that allow manipulating exciton systems within python. To do so, place at the beginning of your script the following lines:
\begin{framed}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/your/exat-g16/src/')
from excsystem import ExcSystem, load_npz, ChromTranList
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{framed}

You can now load the \texttt{exat.npz} file as
\begin{framed}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
exciton_system = load_npz('my.exat.npz')
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{framed}

The exciton Hamiltonian matrix, dipoles, Site energies, etc. will be accessible from the object. They can be also modified. For example,
\begin{framed}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
print(exciton_system.Site)
exciton_system.H[0,0] += 100 
print(exciton_system.Site)
exciton_system.save('modified.exat.npz')
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{framed}
